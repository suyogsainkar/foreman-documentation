= Using Foreman Webhooks 

A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP callbacks". They are usually triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository or a comment being posted to a blog. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook. Users can configure them to cause events on one site to invoke behavior on another. Because webhooks use HTTP, they can be integrated into web services without adding new infrastructure.

When the `foreman_webhooks` plugin is installed, {ProjectServer} can be configured to send webhook requests, however Foreman does not support receiving webhooks. Webhooks are only triggered after an event occurs (there are no "before" events) and are only fire-and-forget as responses are ignored. The typical use case for webhooks is making a call into a monitoring system when a host is created and deleted in Foreman. The monitoring system can create a new host entry and configure a bootstrap process for a monitoring client to perform the initial configuration.

{ProjectServer} and various plugins broadcast internal events which can be subscribed to creation of a Webhook object where target URL and other details are specified. The body of a webhook request, also known as payload, can be customized through an associated Webhook template and can be any HTTP content type. HTTP authentication, content type, and headers can also be configured.
