Webhook HTTP payload must be created via {Project} template syntax. The subject of the event is available via `@object` variable. {Project} ships with an example template for every single event available. For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}appe-Red_Hat_Satellite-Managing_Hosts-Template_Writing_Reference[Template Writing Reference] in _Managing Hosts_ and available template macros and methods, visit `/templates_doc` on a {ProjectServer}.

Webhooks were not designed to call generic APIs, it is not possible to write any logic in templates for example making multiple HTTP requests per event. The primary goal is to call a third-party web service that will provide necessary logic to complete the integration. For simple tasks, there is a {SmartProxy} plugin to write custom shell scripts.
