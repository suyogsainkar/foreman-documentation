== Listing the {Project} Ansible Modules

You can list the installed {Project} Ansible modules by navigating to the following directory:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
----
# ls /usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/redhat/satellite/plugins/modules/
----

Alternatively, you can also see the complete list of {Project} Ansible modules and other related information at https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/redhat/satellite/docs in the Automation Hub.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
----
# ls /usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/theforeman/foreman/plugins/modules/
----

Alternatively, you can also see the complete list of {Project} Ansible modules and other related information at https://galaxy.ansible.com/theforeman/foreman in the Ansible Galaxy.

endif::[]


[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, the `ansible-doc -l` command does not list collections yet.
====

All modules are in the `redhat.satellite` namespace and can be referred to as follows:


ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
----
$ ansible-doc redhat.satellite._module_name_
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
----
$ theforeman.foreman._module_name
----
endif::[]

Note that all modules require the `server_url`, `username`, and `password` parameters.
