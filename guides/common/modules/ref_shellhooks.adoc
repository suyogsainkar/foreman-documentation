= Shellhooks

Optionally, {SmartProxy} Shellhooks plugin can be installed which exposes executables via a REST HTTPS API. Scripts must be placed in `/var/lib/foreman-proxy/shellhooks` as executables with only alphanum characters and underscores and HTTPS payload is passed via standard input, optional command line arguments can be provided via X-Shellhook-Arg-1 to N. HTTP method must be POST, an example URL would be: `https://{smartproxy.example.com}:{smartproxy_port}/shellhooks/my_script`. Authorization with Foreman client checkbox must be enabled for each webhook in order to authorize a call. Standard output and error is redirected to {SmartProxy} log as messages with debug or warning levels respectively. There is no return value from shellhook HTTPS calls.
