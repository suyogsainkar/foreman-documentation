== Using {Project} Ansible Content Collections

The Red Hat Satellite Ansible Content Collections is a set of Ansible modules and plugins to interact with Red Hat Satellite. The modules are based on the upstream https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules/[Foreman Ansible Modules Collection].

Satellite Ansible Content Collection is available with:

* Satellite 6.7 (and newer) via Automation Hub if you have the required Ansible subscription. See Ansible documentation for more information about this installation method.
* Satellite 6.8 via RPM

[NOTE]
====
Installing collections using both methods is only supported in Ansible 2.9 and later. If you are running a version earlier than 2.9, update accordingly:

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-rpms
# foreman-maintain packages update ansible
