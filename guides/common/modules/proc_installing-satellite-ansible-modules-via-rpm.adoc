== Installing the {Project} Ansible Modules via RPM

The {Project} Ansible modules can be installed via RPM. After installing the RPM, you can use the modules in the same way as when they are installed directly from Ansible Galaxy. This eliminates the need to configure Ansible Galaxy and log into the Automation Hub.

.Prerequisite

You will need to enable the Ansible 2.9 (or later) repository. If you are running a version earlier than 2.9, update accordingly:

----
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-rpms
# foreman-maintain packages update ansible
----

.Procedure

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]

. Install the RPM using the following command:
----
# yum install ansible-collection-redhat-satellite --disableplugin=foreman-protector
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
. Install the RPM from the client repository on yum.theforeman.org using the following command:
----
# yum install ansible-collection-theforeman-foreman
----
endif::[]
