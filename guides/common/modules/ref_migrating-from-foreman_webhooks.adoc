= Migrating from Foreman Webhooks

Legacy foreman_hooks plugin provides full access to model objects which the webhooks plugin does not intentionally provide. The scope of what is available is limited by the safemode and all objects and macros are subject to API stability promise and fully documented.

Additionally, the amount of events triggered by webhooks is substantially smaller than with foreman_hooks. Webhooks plugin is designed to be safe, hooks are processed asynchronously so there is minimal risk of tampering with internals of the system. For this reason, it is not possible to migrate from foreman_webhooks without creating payloads per each individual hook script.

Webhooks plugin, however, comes with several example playload templates and together with shellhooks plugin migration should be straightforward. Scripts and/or payload templates will need to be customized in order to achieve similar results.
